I'm a mathematician passionate about machine learning. I recently earned my Master of Science in Mathematics from the New York University Courant Institute with a research focus on neural network generalization from a theoretical/mathematical perspective (May 2025). I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from Tulane University, which I completed in just three years (May 2023). 

My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, abstraction, and analytical thinking. I'm currently seeking opportunities in machine learning where I can bridge rigorous mathematical theory with real-world systems.

I grew up in Austin and recently moved back. In my free time, I'm usually baking, playing guitar, or hanging out with my 3-year-old husky/rottweiler mix, Raymond.
