Do you have a student starting a Calculus course in the fall? Are you concerned that they may need more preparation before tackling such a difficult class?

I am a graduate student at the NYU Courant Institute studying pure mathematics. I am offering a 2-week prep camp for incoming Calculus 1/AB/BC students at both the high school and college level. The camp will run from August 19th-30th, Mondays through Fridays from 10-5 in Midtown Manhattan.

I TA for over 130 Calculus I students each semester, so I am very familiar with the areas where students tend to lack prior knowledge that is necessary for success in Calculus. I also have 5 years of experience tutoring K-12 and college students. I am well-known among NYU students for my ability to break down complicated concepts into digestible pieces. I have created a unique curriculum to prepare students to succeed in Calculus coursework.

The first week of the camp will focus on areas of precalculus that are often overlooked or under-explained. The second week will be all calculus, giving students a head start in the fall.

I will only be accepting 12 students. Several spots will be reserved for students requiring need-based scholarships.
