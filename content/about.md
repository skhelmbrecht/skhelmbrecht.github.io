![Profile Photo](/images/profilephoto.jpeg)

My name is Sarah Helmbrecht, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas. I am in the first semester of my Master of Science in Mathematics at the New York University Courant Institute. I am applying to PhD programs and aspire to become a mathematics professor and researcher. My research interests include analysis and number theory.

I am a Recitation Leader/Teaching Assistant for four sections of Calculus I, with a total of 133 students. I lead weekly recitations, hold office hours, and proctor and grade quizzes and exams. I am passionate about creating inclusive educational spaces that welcome students who lack confidence in their mathematical abilities.

I graduated from Tulane University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2023, after only three years of undergraduate study. While at Tulane, I held membership in Kappa Alpha Theta, the Tulane University Choir, and the Community Action Council of Tulane University Students. I was also involved in community service as an aftercare volunteer at a local elementary school and a contributor to a project with the Louisiana Public Health Institute concerning the improvement of sex education in local schools.

My personal interests include cooking, baking, guitar, piano, songwriting, and spending time with my service dog in training, Raymond (pictured below in his Halloween costume at the Tompkins Square Park dog parade).
