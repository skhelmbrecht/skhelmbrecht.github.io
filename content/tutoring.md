# Qualifications and Methodology 

I am a graduate student at New York University's Courant Institute studying pure mathematics. I have always been passionate about education, and I aspire to become a college professor. While at NYU, I have taught both Calculus 1 and Linear Algebra to undergraduates. For testimonials, please see my [teaching page](https://sarahhelmbrecht.com/teaching/). I have been tutoring math at the undergraduate and high school levels for over 4 years. I started tutoring virtually with a tutoring agency before setting off on my own to do freelance tutoring.

As for my background, I graduated from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas in May 2020 with an International Baccalaureate Certificate and Distinguished Achievement. I scored a 1580 on the SAT (790 math, 790 verbal) in one try with no tutoring or prep courses. I also earned two AP Scholar Awards with Distinction and a National AP Scholar Award for my successes on 12 different AP tests, including Calculus and Statistics. Next, I attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science and a 3.8 GPA after only three years of undergraduate study. I am now working towards my Master's in Mathematics at NYU, and I am in the process of applying to Ph.D. programs.

During my undergraduate experience at Tulane, I took classes on trauma-informed education. This has become especially useful post-pandemic. My approach to tutoring is informed by the idea that many students lost precious years of development, in terms of math skills and beyond, during COVID lockdowns. I assess not only the areas where students need help with their current curriculum, but any prerequisite skills that are lacking so that we can reinforce their foundational knowledge. [Click here](https://sarahhelmbrecht.com/blog/COVIDandMathematicsEducation/) to read a blog post about how I have applied what I learned in one of my favorite education classes.

I firmly believe that my greatest asset as a math educator is that I used to hate math. It was my least favorite subject in high school. I started my undergraduate career at Tulane as a Psychology and Political Economy double major, but I took Calculus 3 during my freshman year to challenge myself. During that semester, I developed a system for succeeding in math courses, [linked here](https://sarahhelmbrecht.com/blog/HowtoAceaCollegeMathClass/). I not only received the highest grade in the class on the final exam, but I fell in love with math for the first time. My favorite part of teaching and tutoring is helping students find the system for success that is best suited for their needs, then guiding them towards a new appreciation for the beauty of math.

I am also very familiar with the unique approach that is required for teaching neurodivergent students. I use a collaborative methodology and incorporate a variety of different perspectives and approaches into sessions to foster engagement. I am passionate about creating inclusive educational spaces that welcome students of all backgrounds, learning styles, and levels of confidence.
