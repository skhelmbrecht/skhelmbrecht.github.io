**Student Testimonials** (from [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2943309))

- Sarah Helmbrecht is a fantastic instructor and clearly cares about her students. She puts extra work into her classes so her students will not only learn but succeed. She goes over steps thoroughly to make sure you understand any math concept. She is attentive to her students and is flexible about her office hours if students need extra help.

- Sarah is one of the best TAs I have ever had. I have never been able to understand the basics of math and especially struggled in a class like calculus. I have been going to all of her office hours, and she has always been able to break down questions and provide extra resources to help me understand a concept. She really cares about her students.

- Sarah happens to be one of the most caring recitation instructors out there, honestly, the best one there is. She is attentive when it comes to making sure her students understand the topics. She believes in the well-being of her students because health always comes first. She also makes herself very accessible to her students during office hours.

- Sarah is the best TA I have ever had. Usually TAs are inaccessible or seem unhelpful but Sarah creates a very good environment where people can reach out to her and feel comfortable getting help.
