I am excited to announce that I have completed the culminating assignment of my undergraduate mathematics career: my Senior Seminar paper. It is an expository article about "A Decoding Approach to Reed-Solomon Codes from Their Definition" by Maria Bras-Amor√≥s. Special thanks to my senior seminar advisor, Dr. Marie Dahleh, and my senior seminar professor, Dr. Tewodros Amdeberhan.
