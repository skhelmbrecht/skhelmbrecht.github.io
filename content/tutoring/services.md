I offer a free 30 minute virtual consultation to discuss your needs and goals, as well as the tutoring process itself.

I am available to tutor in-person in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as virtually. Both in-person and virtual sessions have a minimum length of 1 hour. For virtual sessions, I ask that students be prepared to either screen share while they write on a tablet or set up a camera above their paper so that I can see their work; this is necessary for making virtual sessions interactive.

My rate for one-on-one tutoring is $100/hour. In-person tutoring that requires me to travel more than 30 minutes by transit may incur an additional fee; I am located near NYUâ€™s Washington Square Park campus. I require 12 hours notice for cancellations, and any cancellations within 12 hours of the session start time will result in a charge for the full session.
