      <p>Iâ€™m Sarah, a graduate student at the New York University Courant Institute studying pure mathematics. I have always been passionate about education, and I aspire to become a college professor. While at NYU, I have taught both Calculus I and Linear Algebra to undergraduates. I have been tutoring math at the undergraduate and high school levels for over four years. I am passionate about helping students of all backgrounds, learning styles, and levels of confidence succeed in their math courses. My favorite part of tutoring is helping students find the system for success that is best suited to their needs, and then guiding them toward a newfound appreciation for the beauty of math.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate experience at Tulane, I took classes on trauma-informed education. This has become especially useful post-pandemic. My approach to tutoring is informed by the idea that many students lost precious years of development, in terms of math skills and beyond, during COVID lockdowns. I assess not only the areas where students need help with their current curriculum, but any prerequisite skills that are lacking so that we can reinforce their foundational knowledge.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that my greatest asset as a math educator is that I used to hate math. It was my least favorite subject in high school. I started my undergraduate career at Tulane as a Psychology and Political Economy double major, but I took Calculus 3 during my freshman year to challenge myself. During that semester, I developed a system for succeeding in math courses. I not only earned the highest score in the class on the final exam, but I fell in love with math for the first time. Tutoring provides me with the exciting opportunity to help students find the system that works best for them; I know from personal experience that this can be life-changing.</p>
<p>I am also very familiar with the unique approach that is required for teaching neurodivergent students.
