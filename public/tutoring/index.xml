      <description>I graduated from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas in May 2020 with an International Baccalaureate Certificate and Distinguished Achievement. I scored a 1580 on the SAT (790 math, 790 verbal) in one try with no tutoring or prep courses. I also earned two AP Scholar Awards with Distinction and a National AP Scholar Award for my successes on 12 different AP tests. Next, I attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.</description>

      <description>I offer a free 30 minute consultation to discuss your needs and goals, as well as the tutoring process itself.&#xA;I am available to tutor in-person in Manhattan and some areas of Brooklyn, as well as virtually. My rate for one-on-one tutoring is $100/hour. In-person tutoring that requires me to travel more than 30 minutes by transit may incur an additional fee; I am located near NYUâ€™s main campus in the Village.</description>
