  <div class="about-text">
    <p>I graduated from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas in May 2020 with an International Baccalaureate Certificate and Distinguished Achievement. I scored a 1580 on the SAT (790 math, 790 verbal) in one try with no tutoring or prep courses. I also earned two AP Scholar Awards with Distinction and a National AP Scholar Award for my successes on 12 different AP tests. Next, I attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science and a 3.8 GPA after only three years of undergraduate study. I am now working towards my Masterâ€™s in Mathematics at NYU, and I am in the process of applying to Ph.D. programs.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate experience at Tulane, I took classes on trauma-informed education. This has become especially useful post-pandemic. My approach to tutoring is informed by the idea that many students lost precious years of development, in terms of math skills and beyond, during COVID lockdowns. I assess not only the areas where students need help with their current curriculum, but any prerequisite skills that are lacking so that we can reinforce their foundational knowledge.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that my greatest asset as a math educator is that I used to hate math. It was my least favorite subject in high school. I started my undergraduate career at Tulane as a Psychology and Political Economy double major, but I took Calculus 3 during my freshman year to challenge myself. During that semester, I developed a system for succeeding in math courses. I not only earned the highest score in the class on the final exam, but I fell in love with math for the first time. Tutoring provides me with the exciting opportunity to help students find the system that works best for them; I know from personal experience that this can be life-changing.</p>
<p>I am also very familiar with the unique approach that is required for teaching neurodivergent students. I use a collaborative methodology and incorporate a variety of different perspectives and approaches into sessions to foster engagement. I am passionate about creating inclusive educational spaces that welcome students with diverse needs.</p>
