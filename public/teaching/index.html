<p>Sarah Helmbrecht is a fantastic instructor and clearly cares about her students. She puts extra work into her classes so her students will not only learn but succeed. She goes over steps thoroughly to make sure you understand any math concept. She is attentive to her students and is flexible about her office hours if students need extra help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah is one of the best TAs I have ever had. I have never been able to understand the basics of math and especially struggled in a class like calculus. I have been going to all of her office hours, and she has always been able to break down questions and provide extra resources to help me understand a concept. She really cares about her students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah happens to be one of the most caring recitation instructors out there, honestly, the best one there is. She is attentive when it comes to making sure her students understand the topics. She believes in the well-being of her students because health always comes first. She also makes herself very accessible to her students during office hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah is the best TA I have ever had. Usually TAs are inaccessible or seem unhelpful but Sarah creates a very good environment where people can reach out to her and feel comfortable getting help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is an amazing TA who goes above and beyond for her students. She provides extra math resources and even creates her own outlines and notes. She makes herself very accessible through email and office hours. Even if you are not confident in math she really helps you. She connects with her students and is a really fun TA! Highly recommend her!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah is a great TA. Helps so much and is always doing everything she can to help students in and out of recitations. So nice and really cares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah Helmbrecht has a gift for explaining and communicating calculus concepts that have made me enjoy math. She also understands all the concepts inside and out which makes asking for help very easy. I also appreciate her enthusiasm, she is the best by far. THANKYOU!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah is honestly one of the best TA&rsquo;s you could ask for. She is extremely patient and completely understands how difficult math is for some of us. She&rsquo;s very accommodating, especially with our quizzes, and her office hours are one of the most useful parts of the course. Definitely take her if you can!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah was a great TA. Having an 8 am recitation was a challenge, but Sarah made Friday mornings so much easier with her efficiency in explaining difficult calculus concepts. Weekly quizzes were a breeze after her review packets. She is easy to reach via email and is understanding of students. Raymond (her service dog) made class even better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had her as a TA for Espinosa&rsquo;s calculus class and let&rsquo;s just say she made my life so much easier. She seriously cares about her students and goes out of her way to create notes and literally had a 7 hour office hour session the weekend before the final. She also gives great practice for the final!!! she has a cute dog too which is a plus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Sarah! Her office hours were so helpful and amazing. Whenever I did not understand content she always was there to explain it in a more simple way. She provides many resources that are super helpful. Definitely take her class!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was the BEST TA ever. No TA will ever compare to how amazing she was and how much time and effort she put into recitations and office hours. She once held a 6-hour office session before the final. She is just fantastic!!! Her dog is so cute and loves to play, so make sure you show him some love! Make sure you take her recitation, it is a must!!</p>
