      <description>I graduated from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas in May 2020 with an International Baccalaureate Certificate and Distinguished Achievement. I scored a 1580 on the SAT (790 math, 790 verbal) in one try with no tutoring or prep courses. I also earned two AP Scholar Awards with Distinction and a National AP Scholar Award for my successes on 12 different AP tests. Next, I attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.</description>

      <description>From RateMyProfessors&#xA;Sarah Helmbrecht is a fantastic instructor and clearly cares about her students. She puts extra work into her classes so her students will not only learn but succeed. She goes over steps thoroughly to make sure you understand any math concept. She is attentive to her students and is flexible about her office hours if students need extra help.&#xA;Sarah is one of the best TAs I have ever had.</description>

      <title>How to Ace a College Math Class (From an ADHD Math Grad Student who Used to Hate Math)</title>

      <description>I sent the following document out to my Calculus I students at the beginning of the Fall 2023 semester. I was not always a great math student- in fact, through high school, it was my worst subject. I figured out a system for succeeding in math courses during my freshman year of college. When I started getting better grades, my attitude towards math changed completely. I eventually fell in love with the discipline: the reading, the poetry of proofs, the feeling of finally cracking a difficult problem.</description>

      <title>COVID Trauma and a Critique of Mathematics Education</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in my first semester as a Teaching Assistant for Calculus I at NYU. A student recently pointed out to me that my classes are primarily made up of freshmen, so most of my students took their high school algebra courses on Zoom during the pandemic. This seemingly obvious statement led to a huge revelation for me. Many of my students are learning Calculus content just fine, but they don&amp;rsquo;t know how to factor.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Hugo Blog on GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>I built the first version of this website several months ago using Hugo and GitHub pages. I recently started from scratch so that I could change the theme and fix some mistakes that I made the first time around. In this article, I will share what I have learned.&#xA;There are countless different programs and websites that promise an easy, stress-free website-building experience. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that this way is the easiest, but it allows you to build a completely free website that is much more customizable than the ready-made sites you can find through common website-building platforms.</description>

      <description>This week, I’m graduating from Tulane University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I completed my Bachelor’s in only three years. I’d like to share some of the things that I’ve learned throughout this experience:&#xA;Life WILL get in the way. Put yourself first. Take a mental health day when you need it. Each time I fall apart a little, I worry that it’s going to derail my progress.</description>

      <description>The Most Famous Musicians You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Heard of By Sarah Helmbrecht and JT McDermott&#xA;I. Introduction With the advent of music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and others, it has never been easier to discover new music and artists than it is today. Despite the overall trend towards globalization and unprecedented access to historic catalogs, music tastes are still largely stratified by demographics. This inspired our question: who are the most famous artists and bands that we have never heard of?</description>
