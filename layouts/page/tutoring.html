      <p>I’m Sarah, a graduate student at the New York University Courant Institute studying pure mathematics. I have always been passionate about education, and I aspire to become a college professor. While at NYU, I have taught both Calculus I and Linear Algebra to undergraduates. I have been tutoring math at the undergraduate and high school levels for over four years. I am passionate about helping students of all backgrounds, learning styles, and levels of confidence succeed in their math courses. My favorite part of tutoring is helping students find the system for success that is best suited to their needs, then guiding them towards a newfound appreciation for the beauty of math.</p>
